## 1. Unsupervised Learning

### Dataset: abalone.csv 
**Description**: This dataset is used to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age is determined as Rings + 1.5 (years)
**Variables**: 
- `Sex`: Categorical (M = Male, F = Female, I = Infant)  
- `Length`: Longest shell measurement (mm)  
- `Diameter`: Perpendicular to the length (mm)  
- `Height`: Height with meat inside the shell (mm)  
- `Whole weight`: Weight of the whole abalone (grams)  
- `Shucked weight`: Weight of the meat only (grams)  
- `Viscera weight`: Gut weight after bleeding (grams)  
- `Shell weight`: Weight of the shell after being dried (grams)  
- `Rings`: Integer, used to calculate age.

- `Blast Furnace Slag`: Amount of blast furnace slag (kg in a m³)  
- `Fly Ash`: Amount of fly ash (kg in a m³)  
- `Water`: Amount of water in the mixture (kg in a m³)  
- `Superplasticizer`: Amount of superplasticizer in the mixture (kg in a m³)  
- `Coarse Aggregate`: Amount of coarse aggregate (kg in a m³)  
- `Fine Aggregate`: Amount of fine aggregate (kg in a m³)  
- `Age`: Age of the concrete (days)  
- `Concrete Compressive Strength`: The target variable (MPa)
